# Background Subtraction on SOTA Object Detectors

This repository contains all scripts, configurations, and resources required to reproduce the experiments of the project **“Background Subtraction on SOTA Object Detectors: Does It Worth?”**  
The main goal is to evaluate the impact of combining *Background Subtraction* (BGS) techniques with state-of-the-art object detection models like **YOLOv8** and **Faster R-CNN (Detectron2)**.

## Repository Structure

- **scripts/**: Main scripts for comparisons and analytical terms
- **models/**: SOTA models scriptss.
- **main.py**: Generates results between folders with absolute coordinates

## Required Libraries

To run this project, make sure to have the following key Python libraries installed:

- `opencv-python`
- `numpy`
- `torch`
- `pathlib` (standard library, but good to check)
- `ultralytics` (for YOLOv8)
- `detectron2` (for Faster R-CNN)

## Important Notice

### Define input and output folders

First, define the folders where the results generated by each model will be saved.
The folder structure can be organized as you prefer, but you must update these paths in each script.

input_dir = Path("./Raw/Raw")          # Folder with input videos
output_folder = Path("./YOLO/Yolo")    # Folder to store generated TXT files

    Currently, the scripts are designed to process videos only.
    If you want to process a sequence of images instead, you will need to adapt the original script manually.

### Run the models to generate predictions

Once the paths are set, run each script to generate .txt files containing the detections.
These files will be saved in the specified output folder.

### Compute metrics in main.py

After generating the prediction files, update the paths inside main.py to point to the results.

Keep in mind:

    main.py runs the evaluation for one model at a time.

    To compute metrics for another model, update the paths and run the script again.

### Ground Truth required

Remember that having the Ground Truth is mandatory to perform the comparisons.
Without it, you will not be able to calculate precision, recall, or F1-Score.


### This pipeline critically depends on two major frameworks:
 **Detectron2 (Meta AI)**  
 **YOLO (Ultralytics)**

> **Note:**  
Detectron2 requires proper installation and configuration, including matching your `torch` and `CUDA` versions (if using GPU acceleration). Please follow the [official Detectron2 installation guide](https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/) to ensure compatibility.

> **Note:**  
YOLOv8 (Ultralytics) should be installed via `pip` (`pip install ultralytics`) to ensure you have the latest stable version with full functionality.

## Recommended Installation

We strongly recommend using a virtual environment (e.g., `conda` or `venv`) to avoid conflicts.  
Example with **conda** and **CUDA 11.8**:
